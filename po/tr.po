"the southern cities of the farnorth where there were still threats and risks "

"These conflicts were of no importance to drakes and their lord, Eagi-Nyess, "
"living on Shimmering Isle. The island were north and west of Wesnoth, and "
"well out to sea, lying west of the city of Prestim. Because the island were "
"isolated from the mainland, life there was peaceful. Although there were "
"some other creatures in the west and south of the island, Lord Eagi-Nyess, "
"whose main castle was located at the northeast, called Svearg, was the ruler "
"in the whole island.\n"
"Drakes are loyal and honorable and trust each other absolutely. Unlike human "
"society, treachery and cheating and double-dealing do not exist in drake "
"culture. These traits led to a friendship with an elder wose, named "
"Orofarnië, who excelled in making predictions, and who lived on the mainland "
"of the island long before drakes even existed."

"Nagas repeatedly disrupted peace in the world of the Drakes, and the gravest "
"Naga threat came in a conflict called the Battle of Shimmering Isle. A Naga "
"dictator named Zpsekk forced many local groups of Nagas to join his fight. "
"He divided his large Naga army into three groups that were to attack the "
"island from three different directions. Orofarnië’s foresight, and "
"suggestions, helped the Drakes to identify the weaker of the three attacking "
"forces. The Drakes then focused on the weakest force, and soon defeated "
"them. Immediately, a small, fast squad of Drakes led by Wyngilla pushed "
"through the opening, reached Zpsekk, and assassinated him. This shrewd "
"strategy caused the Naga army to scatter."
